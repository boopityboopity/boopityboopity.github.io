          <p class="PoemParagraph"> <!--{{{-->
            <span> The resonating sounds, </span>
            <span> of the few songs and laughs we shared. </span>
            <span> The comfort and honesty, </span>
            <span> of the "thing" we had; it was obvious that she cared. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> The enjoyment of seeing her open up, </span>
            <span> closer and closer she came, </span>
            <span> until the day she told me, </span>
            <span> that I was more than a friend. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> On my knees, in my head </span>
            <span> a million scenarios of a future ahead. </span>
            <span> Constantly thinking of what we are and could be, </span>
            <span> taking down notes to organize my thoughts and god help me- </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> To this day, I often wonder, </span>
            <span> how did my empty mug suddenly get filled to the brim with water? </span>
            <span> my silent abode, suddenly filled with laughter, </span>
            <span> the empty pages, filled with a story - so much broader </span>
            <span> my life, filled with something much greater; </span>
            <span> that which is, you. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> I continue to want to give you all that could be, </span>
            <span> for the Lady that deserved the world and-fuck me, </span>
            <span> I wanted to give her the stars and happiness for the entirety; </span>
            <span> of the short time we have, on earth. </span>
            <span> Maybe a little bit of variety. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> The thoughtful, loving nature of this person, </span>
            <span> She who cares, and thinks of more than herself - </span>
            <span> The genuine, overthinking, humorous person she is; </span>
            <span> She, who i love and is wiz, </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> She is she, </span>
            <span> and that's more than enough of a reason to love her. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> To "She", I would like to ascertain, </span>
            <span> That today, that in which we celebrate the fact that you "are", </span>
            <span> I am more than glad that you're here even with your scars. </span>
            <span> After everything you've been through, </span>
            <span> you're still a bright shining star even from afar. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> To the future that may, or may not be, </span>
            <span> To us in the future, that i wish for there to be; </span>
            <span> Looking forward to each time we both turn older, </span>
            <span> And that with each day, we grow even closer. </span>
            <span> To a future, with "She" - no, you </span>
            <span> I celebrate. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="PoemParagraph">
            <span> For having been </span>
            <span> being </span>
            <span> and hopefully - to be. </span>
